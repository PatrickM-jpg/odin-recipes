    <h2>Description:</h2>

    <p>Is there anything more comforting than a big plate of homemade lasagna? I’ve been working on a go-to lasagna recipe that is perfect for my family: easy to put together (you can have this done in 90 minutes!), to-die-for-flavor, LOTS of cheesy goodness, and NO boiling noodles (who has the time?) I'll show you all the details, step-by-step, for how to make the best lasagna of your life!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>No boil lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>Ricotta</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        <li>Sliced Mozzarella Cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Make the sauce. You need a red sauce with meat, and I have two great recipes you can use: Easy Spaghetti Sauce (30 minutes) or Homemade Bolognese Sauce, which is going to take at least 90 minutes. You can make either sauce 24 hours ahead of time and store in the fridge.</li>
        <li>Make the ricotta filling. We got some cheese, we got some egg, we got some parm. Try not to eat it all with a spoon.</li>
        <li>Slice and shred your cheese: mozzarella and more Parmesan. more! more!</li>
        <li>Open your box of no boil noodles. Thaaaaat's it.</li>
        <li>Layer it up: follow instructions below for what order to put it all in. I have tried to use diagrams and small words for all the idiots out there like me.</li>
        <li>Bake at 375˚ for about an hour. See that's it, isn't lasagna so easy??</li>
    </ol>
